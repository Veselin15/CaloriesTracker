Project Plan: Calories Tracker
1. Core Models (at least 5)
1. User
Use Django’s built-in User model (or extend it for profile info).
2. Food
Stores food items, their nutritional values, and optional brand info.
Fields: name, brand, description, calories, fat, carbs, protein, serving_size, etc.
3. FoodEaten (already present)
Logs what a user eats, when, and in what quantity.
Fields: user, food, quantity, measurement_type, unit_label, date_eaten, etc.
4. Meal
Groups multiple FoodEaten entries into a meal (breakfast, lunch, etc.).
Fields: user, name (e.g., "Breakfast"), date, foods (ManyToMany to FoodEaten).
5. Goal
Stores user-specific goals (calories, macros, weight, etc.).
Fields: user, daily_calorie_goal, protein_goal, carbs_goal, fat_goal, weight_goal, etc.
6. (Optional) WeightLog
Tracks user’s weight over time.
Fields: user, weight, date_logged.
2. Features & Functionality
A. Food Search & Logging
Search for foods (API or local DB).
Log foods eaten with quantity and date.
B. Meal Management
Allow users to group foods into meals.
View meal summaries.
C. Goals & Progress
Users set daily/weekly goals for calories/macros/weight.
Compare intake vs. goals.
D. Graphs & Visualization
Calories over time (daily, weekly, monthly).
Macronutrient breakdown (pie chart for fat/carbs/protein).
Progress toward goals (bar/line charts).
Weight trend (if WeightLog is implemented).
E. User Dashboard
Show today’s intake, remaining calories, recent meals, and graphs.
3. Graphs Implementation Ideas
Use Chart.js or Plotly.js for interactive graphs in your Django templates.
Backend: Aggregate data (calories per day, macros per meal, etc.) and pass to templates as JSON.
Example graphs:
Line Chart: Calories consumed per day over the last 30 days.
Pie Chart: Today’s macronutrient distribution.
Bar Chart: Comparison of intake vs. goals.
4. Suggested Steps
Design Models
Implement the 5+ models above in models.py.
Migrations
Run migrations to create tables.
Forms & Views
Create forms for logging food, meals, goals, and weight.
Build views for dashboard, food search, meal logging, and goal setting.
Templates
Build pages for dashboard, food search, meal log, and progress.
Graph Integration
Aggregate data in views.
Pass data to templates and render with Chart.js/Plotly.
Testing & Polish
Test all flows.
Add user feedback, error handling, and polish UI.
5. Extra Ideas
Reminders/Notifications: Remind users to log meals or weigh in.
Export Data: Allow users to export their logs as CSV.
Social Features: Share progress with friends.
Achievements: Award badges for streaks or goals met.
